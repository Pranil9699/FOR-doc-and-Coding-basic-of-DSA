# Stack

#### Stack is Linear Data Struture.
#### Stacks are dynamic data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.


Stacks have restrictions on the insertion and deletion of elements.

The element at the top is called the **Top** element.

# Stack Operations

### 1. **Insertion (Push)**
- Used the `push([parameter])` method to add an element to the top of the stack.
  
### 2. **Deletion (Pop)**
- Used the `pop()` method to remove the top element from the stack.

### 3. **Peek/Top**
- Used the `peek()` or `top()` method to view the top element without removing it.

### 4. **Check if Empty**
- Used the `isEmpty()` method to check if the stack has no elements.

### 5. **Check if Full (for fixed-size stacks)**
- Used the `isFull()` method to check if the stack is full and cannot accommodate more elements.
